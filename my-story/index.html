    <h1>"My Story"</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in 1997 in Samut Prakan province.
      <br /><br />
      I attended Wat Suan Som School from kindergarten to Grade 6 and continued
      my secondary education at Wisutthikasatree School.
      <br /><br />
      After completing high school, due to various problems, I did not pursue
      further education at the university.

    <h2>The beginning of working life.</h2>
    <p>
      After finishing my studies, I had to find a job, leading me to work in
      various roles since a young age.
      <br /><br />
      I started as a salesperson in a department store,
      <br /><br />
      then worked in a factory, and later became a bank officer.
