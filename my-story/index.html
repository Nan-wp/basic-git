      <h1>"My Story"</h1>
      <p>
        Hi my name's Wiphaphorn Phormphoklang. You can call me 'Nan'. I was born
        in 1997 in Samut Prakan province.
        <br /><br />
        I attended Wat Suan Som School from kindergarten to Grade 6 and
        continued my secondary education at Wisutthikasatree School.
        <br /><br />
        After completing high school, due to various problems, I did not pursue
        further education at the university.

      <h3>The beginning of working life</h3>
      <p>
        After finishing my studies, I had to find a job, leading me to work in
        various roles since a young age.
        <br /><br />
        I started as a salesperson in a department store,
        <br /><br />
        then worked in a factory, and later became a bank officer.

      <h3>Wiphaphorn's Nowadays</h3>
      <p>
        After experiencing different jobs, I realized the importance of pursuing
        <br /><br />
        my own dreams. When the opportunity presented itself, I promptly took
        it,
        <br /><br />
        and now I am a learner in the Junior software developer cohort6.
